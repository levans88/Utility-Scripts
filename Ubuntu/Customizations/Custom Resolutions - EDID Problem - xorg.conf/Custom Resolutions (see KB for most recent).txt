Adding custom resolution(s) is necessary if VGA equipment (like extenders or matrix boxes) blocks the EDID coming to the computer. In that case 1920x1080 might not be available.

It is *possible* that the nouveau driver allowed simply adding the missing resolutions, but the Nvidia binary driver gives error "badmatch"...

The solution is to ignore the EDID for the SPECIFIC output port in question but allow the other ports to still use EDID. Mine analog output is DVI-I-0, which at the moment outputs over VGA to a 4-port matrix. The matrix then supplies the video signal to my primary LCD, a VGA extender box going to a TV over CAT5, and another TV over unamplified CAT5. So even if an EDID was to be returned, I don't know how it is resolved which would be used...


Solution
--------
To ignore the EDID for a specific port, create a custom xorg.conf:

	1) Have the Nvidia X Server Settings tool create the xorg.conf file first: 
		- Find the option, "Save to X Configuration File"
		- The usage of this file is not deprecated but most people no longer need it.
	
	2) If not already done, plug the monitor in digitally and "Acquire EDID" using the same Nvidia X Server Settings tool (I have two of the same so I queried the one already hooked up digitally).
		- Install "edid-decode" if missing:

			sudo apt-get install edid-decode
		
		- Decode the bin file:

			edid-decode edid.bin
		
		- Now you will see the Monitor Ranges near the bottom of the output (V and H)
		- Write them down

	2) Modify your custom xorg.conf as follows:
		- Under Section "Monitor", replace HorizSync and VertRefresh with valid values for the display obtained in the previous step, mine were:

			HorizSync		30.0 - 80.0
    		VertRefresh		55.0 - 76.0

    	- Under Section "Device", add the following line (change port name as needed):
    		
    		Option "UseEdid" "DVI-I-0:False"

    	- Without the port prefix, ALL EDID's will be ignored.

	3) Put the file in /etc/X11

	4) Reboot

	5) Add any missing custom resolutions. I had to add 1280x720 as follows:

		cvt 1280 720
		
		sudo xrandr --newmode "1280x720_60.00"   74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync

		sudo xrandr --addmode DVI-I-0 "1280x720_60.00"
